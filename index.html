        Montana is a western state defined by its diverse terrain ranging from
        the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains. Its wide-open spaces include
        Glacier National Park, a vast wilderness preserve that passes into
        Canada. The parkâ€™s many snow-capped peaks, lakes and alpine hiking
        trails are showcased along its famed Going-to-the-Sun Road, stretching
        50 miles.

        Maybe it's the independent frontier spirit, wild and free and
        oh-so-American, that earned Montana its 'live and let live' state motto.
        The sky seems bigger and bluer. The air is crisp and pine-scented. From
        mountains that drop into undulating ranchlands to brick brewhouses and
        the shaggy grizzly found lapping at an ice-blue glacier lake, Montana
        brings you to that euphoric place, naturally. And then it remains with
        you long after you've left its beautiful spaces behind.
